    "text": "Hello, doctor. I would like to explain my health problem in detail. For the past three to four weeks, I have been having frequent discomfort in my chest. It usually feels like a heavy pressure or tightness in the middle of my chest, as if something is pressing on it. This pain mostly happens when I walk fast, climb stairs, carry heavy bags, or do any physical work. When I stop and rest for a few minutes, the pain slowly reduces. Sometimes the pain spreads to my left shoulder, left arm, neck, and jaw, along with the chest pain, I often feel short of breath. Even small activities like walking for five minutes or going up one floor make me tired. I also feel very weak and exhausted most of the time. During some of these episodes, I start sweating suddenly. Even when the weather is not hot, I feel dizzy and light-headed, and sometimes I feel like I might faint. My heartbeat becomes very fast and irregular during these times. I have also noticed that these symptoms are becoming more frequent and stronger. Earlier, it happened only once or twice a week, but now it is happening almost every day. I have high blood pressure for the last six years and I am taking medicines irregularly. I also have high cholesterol. I smoke around five to six cigarettes per day and sometimes drink alcohol on weekends. I do not exercise regularly, and most of my time is spent sitting at work. Recently, I have started feeling anxious and scared because of these symptoms. At night, when I lie down, I sometimes feel mild chest discomfort and difficulty in breathing. I also wake up suddenly from sleep with a feeling of suffocation. There are times when I feel pain, even when I am resting, especially after eating heavy food or feeling stressed. I also get frequent headaches and blurred vision. My father had a heart attack at the age of 55 and my mother has diabetes. Because of this family history, I am very worried that I may also have a serious heart problem. I have not done any he.",
