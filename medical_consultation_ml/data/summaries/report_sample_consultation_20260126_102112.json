    "text": "Doctor: Good morning. What brings you here today? Patient: Hi doctor. I've been having a fever for the past three days, and I'm also experiencing a bad cough. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the fever? How high has it been? Patient: It's been around 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit. I've also had body aches and fatigue. Doctor: Any shortness of breath or chest pain? Patient: No chest pain, but sometimes the cough makes it hard to breathe. Doctor: Okay. Let me examine you. *examines patient* Your lungs sound a bit congested. Based on your symptoms, it appears you have an upper respiratory infection, possibly bronchitis. Patient: What should I do about it? Doctor: I'm going to prescribe you Amoxicillin 500mg, take it three times daily for 7 days. This antibiotic will help fight the infection. Also, take Ibuprofen 400mg every 6 hours as needed for the fever and body aches. For the cough, I recommend Dextromethorphan 10mg syrup, take 2 teaspoons three times a day. Patient: Should I do anything else? Doctor: Yes, make sure to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and use a humidifier if you have one. If your symptoms worsen or you develop difficulty breathing, come back immediately. Patient: Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Follow up in one week if symptoms persist. Take care.",
